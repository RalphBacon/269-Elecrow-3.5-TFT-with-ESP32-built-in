### INFO

I've included the (severely cut down) User_Setup.h file with the relevant lines uncommented so you can use this straight away with the TFT_eSPI library, which you can get from here: https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI  

It's always best to use the latest version in order to ensure you have all the bug fixes and amendements.
